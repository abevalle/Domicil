Currently still in planning phases. We are boiling down our idea to a MVP.

####ToDO
* Learn about realesate website APIs if they're available. Something like: Zillo, Redfin, Realotr.net, etc
* Come up with an algorithm to scrape and organized realestate data
* Find a way to identify construction of the house. brick, stick, curtain wall, etc
* Calculate cost per square foot
* Compare rent prices in a mile radius
* Scrape both rental data and Selling data

####Potential post MVP Goals
* Calculate potential rent based on unit types and local rent.
* Present this data using a clean UI
* Pull property Tax info from local GIS system
* Pull Deeds proprty from property records portal
* Verify that no liens exist on the property
* Determin how many legal rentable units exist
* Analyse trends, which houses come back on the market. Which houses are flipped, estimated profit?
* get hard distance to, bus stop, train, school
* compare  'Walkability, School, etc' scores from pulled sources
